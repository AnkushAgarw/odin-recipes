    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried rice is a staple of Aussie takeaway. We love fried rice. And, while we might all have our favourite restaurant that makes Chinese fried rice just the way we like it, satisfying fried rice and egg fried rice is a dish that is easy to replicate at home.</p>
    <p>In this super simple version we use pantry and fridge staples, but the beauty of basic fried rice recipes is that you can always adjust the ingredients based on what you happen to have on hand at any given time.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Coles Long Grain White Rice</li>
        <li>2 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
        <li>2 bacon rashers, chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>2 shallots, trimmed, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed (see notes for Low FODMAP substitution)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds, to serve</li>
        <li>Shallots, sliced, extra, to serve</li>
    </ul>
